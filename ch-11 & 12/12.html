            The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like, <strong><em>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</em></strong> while introducing the students
            to development of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.

        <p class="description">
            The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like <strong><em>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</em></strong> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js.
            The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.

            The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source development technologies like <strong><em>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</em></strong> while making them
            efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
